"He said they ate meat.",
"My brother didn't know anything about dragons. He didn't know anything about anything.",
"E",
"She was Drogo's first gift to me.",

"What do you know of this place?",
"I thought we were welcome here.",
"Horde?",
"My name is Danaerys-",
"You know me, my Lord?",
"And what should I call you?",
"The beauty of Quarth is legenda-",
"Qarth.",
"My... friend. We have travelled very far. We have no food, no water. Once I see my people fed I would be honored-",
"I am not a liar.",
"Where I come from, guests are treated with respect, not insulted at the gates.",
"What are you doing? You promised to receive me!",
"If you do not let us in, all of us *will* die!",
"Thirteen!",
"When my dragons are grown, we will take back what was stolen from me, and *destroy* those who have wronged me! We will lay waste to armies and burn cities to the ground! Turn us away, and we will burn you first.",
"It sounds wonderful.",
"Please excuse me for a moment",
"What are they doing?",
"Kisha nevaki mae! Yer laz vos vefenari mae, vos tavi mae, vos ivvisi mae.", //"We are his guests! You can not pry it, nor chop it, nor melt it."
"Kash athezar kishi vos akka.", //"During our departure, not even."
"Hash idrik kishi vijazero kisha Athasaroon Virzetha hash yer zali zifichelat moon? Anha acharak vos alikh.", //"Our host saved us from the Red Waste and you want to steal from him? I will hear no more."
"My brother used to say the only thing the Dothraki know how to do is steal the things better men have built.",
"That's not the kind of Queen I'm going to be.",
"What is the House of the Undying?",
"*laughs*",
"The Seven Kingdoms are at war with one another! Four false kings destroying the country-",
"The Usurper is dead! The Starks fight the Lannisters! The Baratheons fight each other!",
"The time to strike is now! We need to find ships and an army, or we'll spend the rest of our lives rotting away at the edge of the world.",
"And if I'd listened to that advice outside the gates of Qarth, we'd all be dead by now.",
"Do not speak to me like I'm a child!",
"What do you want? Tell me.",
"Why?",
"So what would you have me do, as my advisor?",
"And how do I get this ship?",
"I look forward to meeting him.",
"The Spice King refuses me because I'm a bad investment, the Silk King won't supprt me because of his business with the Lannisters- why offend his best customer? And the Copper King offers me a single ship on the condition that I lie with him for a night. Does he think I will whore myself for a boat?",
"Where are they?",
"WHERE ARE MY DRAGONS?!",
"You came back.",
"Irri is dead.",
"She's dead. She died alone, she died for me, and I couldn't protect her.",
"We can't find her. She must be dead too.",
"I lead my people out of the Red Waste and into the slaughterhouse.",
"You went to find me a ship.",
"These people?",
"And who is to be trusted? Who are my people? The Targaryens? I only knew one, my brother, and he would've let a thousand men rape me if it would've gotten him a crown. The Dothraki? Most of them turned from me the day Khal Drogo fell from his horse.",
"The people in Westeros don't know I'm alive.",
"And then what? They'll pray for my return? They'll wave dragon banners and shout for my name? That's what my brother believed and he was a fool.",
"There it is, 'trust me'. And it's you I should trust, Ser Jorah? Only you?",
"I don't *need* trust any longer. I don't want it and I don't have room for it.",
"And you are too familiar.",
"Find my dragons.",
"Astapor?",
"They have my dragons. A mother does not flee without her children.",
"You should sail to Astapor, I'm sure you'll be safe there.",
"Then serve me. If my dragons are in the House of the Undying, then take me there.",
"And what of my magic? You saw me step into the fire, you watched the witch burn! What did the flames do to me? Do you remember?",
"They are my children. And they are the only children I will ever have. Take me to them.",
"Azhi morea kis tat.", //"Let them try."
"Jini athmovezar qoyi ven athmovezar fini fich yera anhoonâ€”fini fich yera anhoon hatifâ€¦", //"This is dark magic, like the magic that took you from me. Took you from before I could evenâ€¦"
"Ishish anha drivak vosma anha ray nesok mae vos. Ishish anha ma yeroon she Rhaeshi Ajjalani.", //"Maybe I am dead and I just donâ€™t know it yet. Maybe I am with you in the Night Lands."
"Jini vena tikh meyer jif ti.", //"That sounds like something that you would do."
"This is not my home. My home is across the sea where my people are waiting for me.",
"Dracarys.", //"Dragonfire"
"Not fast enough. I can't wait that long.",
"I need an army.",
"The greatest *slave* soldiers in the world. The distinction means a great deal to some people.",
"It's too beautiful a day to argue.",
"Don't mock them. They're the first Dothraki who've ever been on a ship. They followed me across the poison water. If they'll do it, others will. And with a proper Khalasar-",
"They may suit my needs. Tell me of their training.",
"Tell the Good Master, there is no need-",
"You take a babe, from it's mothers eyes, kill it as she watches, and pay for her pain with a silver coin?",
"How many do you have to sell?",
"8000 *thousand* dead babies.",
"Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?",
"*giggles*",
"The Warlocks.",
"I owe you my life, Ser.",
"You know this man?",
